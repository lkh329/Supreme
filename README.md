# Supreme: Fine-grained Radio map Reconstruction via Spatial-Temporal Fusion Network
In this paper, we propose a fine-grained radio map reconstruction framework, called Supreme, based on
crowd-sourced data in an image super-resolution manner.

## Requirements
Supreme uses the following dependencies:
* [Pytorch 0.4.3](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and its dependencies
* Numpy, Scipy and Pandas
* CUDA 10.0 or latest version. And **cuDNN** is highly recommended
